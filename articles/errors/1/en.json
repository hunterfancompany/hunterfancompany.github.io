activate more than 1 SIMPLEconnect Hunter Fan, please power on and activate 
only one fan at a time to ensure 2 things:\n - Correct remote is paired\n - 
Correct activation code is used (the one with the Home Icon on the top)\n\n## 
If you have only one SIMPLEconnect Hunter Fan\n\nIf you encounter “setup code 
incorrect” issue please verify the QR code inside the remote, manual and on 
top of the fan — they should be the same. If they differ try the code in the 
manual and on the fan top — this should work.\n\nIf all the codes (remote, 
manual, top of the fan) are the same, but you still receive the error 
'incorrect setup code' — please [contact support](hunterfan://support?id=1)",
