# Setup Code Incorrect

## If you have multiple fans

If you're trying to activate more than 1 SIMPLEconnect Hunter Fan, please power on and activate only one fan at a time to ensure 2 things:
 - Correct remote is paired
 - Correct activation code is used (the one with the Home Icon on the top)

## If you have only one SIMPLEconnect Hunter Fan

If you encounter “setup code incorrect” issue please verify the QR code inside the remote, manual and on top of the fan — they should be the same. If they differ try the code in the manual and on the fan top — this should work.

If all the codes (remote, manual, top of the fan) are the same, but you still receive the error 'incorrect setup code' — please [contact support](hunterfan://support?id=1)
